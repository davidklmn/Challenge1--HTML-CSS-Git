# Challenge 01 - HTML, CSS and Git

## Description

This is my take on the Module 1 challenge of the Front End Bootcamp.
I changed the starter code to be as accessible as possible.

My changes included:

- Elements changed to Semantoc HTML elements for easier identification and more legibility/logical struture,
- CSS selectors changed for the corresponding HTML elements and classes/ids,
- img alt attributes added for accessibility,
- Descriptive title added.

I learnt a lot about semantic elements and accesibility and its importance in web development.

## Credits

Colt Steele's video about Semantic HTML helped me a lot to understand the basic concepts for this project.
